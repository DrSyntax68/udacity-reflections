How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

     Staging area is  tempory area where files to be committed are stored.  The working directory ill store all the files in the directory whereas the repository will only have files that it is tracking.  The repository is good for making sure that all the files for that project are in one place.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

     Help explain what is up/down stream for changes and where you may need to create the next branch.  Also shows what changes have happened since you booked out.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

     good that it check for the error. still prefer mainframe more accurate and easy to tell difference.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

     Impletmenting future upgrades/bug fixes.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

     After making change move to staging area so that if bug introduces and copy back from staging area.

Compare file in staging area to the repository then check that the files in staging are the file that need to be committed.
