How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Line changes were easy to see. Easy to not scroll up to top of comparison and miss lines.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    if new code goes wrong easy to roll back.  Changes not authourised can be removed.  

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Prefer mainframe way of version control. Manual allows errors. Auto does help with disaster recovery.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Google extects you to work seperatly as there are not many cases where mulriply changes over many filkes is common.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    log - shows comments of previous changes
    diff - shows actual code changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If code breaks you can roll back to the last commit

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Any projects that i am working on
